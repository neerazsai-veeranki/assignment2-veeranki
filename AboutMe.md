# Neerazsai Veeranki

I'm a travel enthusiast who loves to go on a very long road trips, eespecially on motorcycles. I recently got this interest after seeing, people travelling places around the world. my dream is to explore an unexplored place and its beauty on motorcycle. Ofcourse its a very stressfull and energy consuming thing to drive for that long periods of time, but i believe with a right company of friends it would be a life time memory to cherish.
